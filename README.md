This repo contains a simplified version of the official "PhotoStoreDemo" Sparse Package sample code. This version focuses on how to add a very simple Windows 11 context menu extension.

You can learn more about the Windows 11 context menu on my [post](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/07/19/extending-the-context-menu-and-share-dialog-in-windows-11/) on the Windows Developer blog.

### Instructions

TODO - I'm planning to make a tutorial video and other utilities to help here. Stay tuned.
